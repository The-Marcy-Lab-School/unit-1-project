    <p> For people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, living outdoors poses a greater risk during winter. Cold weather can cause hypothermia – where your body loses heat faster than it can be produced. People experiencing homelessness tend to lack access to vital resources, including insulated winter clothes and warm shelter. This is especially true at night, when temperatures can drop below freezing.

When your body temperature is at 95 degrees Fahrenheit or below, it becomes critical to seek help. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), low body temperature affects the brain; hypothermia symptoms include:

Memory loss
Slurred speech
Drowsiness
Shivering
Frostbite is another risk – usually affecting the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes, according to the CDC. Severe cases of frostbite can lead to amputation if left untreated. People experiencing homelessness may not be able to seek medical attention, especially when there is lack of access to affordable transportation. </p>
