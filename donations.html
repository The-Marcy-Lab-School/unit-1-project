                <!--<h4>Coalition for the homeless</h4>-->
                <p>The Coalition greatly appreciates your interest in volunteering and helping homeless New Yorkers. In an effort to maintain social distancing and prevent spread of the virus, we have limited our volunteer opportunities.One great way to get involved is through our Grand Central Food Program. We are scheduling a limited number of volunteers to join us at St. Bartholomew’s Church from 4:30pm until 6:30pm Monday through Friday.The Grand Central Food Program is also looking for weekend volunteer drivers from 6:45pm until roughly 9:30pm. The route begins and ends at St. Bartholomew’s Church on 51st Street. This opportunity requires that you commit to joining us consistently.</p>

                <h4 class="card-title">Neighborhood Coalition For shelter</h4>
                <p>NCS was founded on the premise that homelessness is the responsibility of the entire community. More than 35 years later, we are still guided by the principle that neighbors should help neighbors. This is why volunteerism has always been important to the work we do.
                    We love when volunteers come to NCS to spend time with our residents, help us in the office, or share their unique skills.</p>

                <p>We are able to enrich our programming and the cultural experiences of the children and adults we serve through our volunteers and partners. Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds and are always welcome to share their time and talent with our community through a variety of available projects, events, and partnership opportunities. Previous volunteer activities have included recreational outings such as ice skating and watching a professional baseball game, as well as practical in-house workshops on financial literacy and healthy eating.
                    HFH is always seeking energetic people with experience in the arts, sciences, mathematics, and/or literacy to organize volunteer events.</p>
