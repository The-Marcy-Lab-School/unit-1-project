Lambskin condoms are less effective at preventing STIs since they contain tiny holes, which are small enough to block sperm but big enough to let bacteria through. Condoms can be obtained for free from some health centers, and can be purchased online or in drugstores in packs of 3 for $2 to $6. Packs of 12 or more typically are less than $1 each.</h6>

                            <h4>Breastfeeding as Birth Control/ Lactational Amenorrhea (LAM)</h4>
                            <h6>By exclusively breastfeeding for the first 6 months after a baby is born, a woman can stop ovulation and her period naturally. For this to be effective, she must nurse your baby every 4-5 hours, and every 6 hours at night. This method is called LAM for "lactational" referring to breastfeeding, and "amenorrhea" referring to not having a period. This is only effective for the first 6 months where a mother breastfeeds.</h6>

                            <h4>Sterilization/Tubal Ligation/Tube Tying</h4>
                            <h6>There are three types of sterilization, which are tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, and Essure sterilization. Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that permanently cuts, closes, or removes parts of the fallopian tubes. Bilateral salpingectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the fallopian tubes entirely. Essure sterilization is a small coil that a medical professional inserts into the fallopian tubes to block them, but is no longer available in the United States.</h6>

                            <h4>Vasectomy</h4>
                            <h6>There are two types of vasectomies, which are the incision and no-scalpel (no-cut) methods. The small tubes in the scrotum that can carry semen are cut or blocked off in order to prevent pregnancy. The no-cut method is less likely to get infected or have any complications, and generally takes less time to heal. Vasectomies are usually not reversable.</h6>
